# Polypyus Firmware Historian
*Polypyus* learns to locate functions in raw binaries by extracting known functions from similar binaries.
Thus, it is a firmware historian. *Polypyus* works without disassembling these binaries, which is an advantage
for binaries that are complex to disassemble and where common tools miss functions. In addition, the binary-only
approach makes it very fast and run within a few seconds. However, this approach
requires the binaries to be for the same architecture and have similar compiler options.

*Polypyus* integrates into the workflow of existing tools like *Ghidra*, *IDA*, *BinDiff*, and *Diaphora*.
For example, it can import previously annotated functions and learn from these, and also export found functions to be
imported into *IDA*. Since *Polypyus* uses rather strict thresholds, it only found correct matches in our experiments.
While this leads to fewer results than in existing tools, it is a good entry point for loading these matches into
*IDA* to improve its auto analysis results and then run *BinDiff* on top.

## What Polypyus solves
When working on raw firmware binaries, namely various *Broadcom* and *Cypress* Bluetooth firmware versions,
we found that *IDA* auto analysis often identified function starts incorrectly. In *IDA Pro 6.8* the auto
analysis is a bit more aggressive, leading to more results but also more false positives. Overall, *IDA Pro 7.2*
was more pessimistic, but missed a lot of functions. This led to only a few *BinDiff* matches between our firmwares in
*IDA Pro 6.8* and no useful matches at all in *IDA Pro 7.2*.

Interestingly, *BinDiff* often failed to identify
functions that, except from branches, were byte-identical. Note that *Polypyus* searches exactly for these
byte-identical functions. We assume that *BinDiff* fails at these functions due to a different
call graph produced by missing functions and false positives. Sometimes, these functions were already recognized
by *IDA*, but often, *IDA* did either not recognize these as code or not mark them as function.
Note that *Diaphora* has similar problems, as it exports functions identified by *IDA* before further processing
them. The following shows a benchmark on the *CYW20735B1* Bluetooth firmware binary that compares various
disassemblers and how the disassembler failures result in follow-up diffing issues.

![Benchmark comparing IDA Pro, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, radare2, BinDiff and Diaphora](doc/disassembler_bindiff_benchmark.svg)

Moreover, while we found that *Amnesia* finds many functions, it also finds many
false positives. However, many functions have a similar stack frame
setup in the beginning. Thus, *Polypyus* has an option to learn common function starts from the annotated
input binaries and apply this to other binaries to identify functions without matching their name.
This optional step is only applied to the regions in which no functions were previously located,
this way the common function starts method and the main function finding do not conflict.

Since these matchers work on the raw binary, they do not depend on a disassembler. This also has
one important drawback: if there were different compiler options or a different target architecture,
Polypyus will not detect similar functions. Moreover, while the identified matches are very reliable,
the function start identification is a bit less reliable, so use the latter with care.
In the following, you can see that the
Cypress evaluation kits are very similar to each other, but the MacBook firmware is very different.

## How it works

*Polypyus* creates fuzzy binary matchers by comparing common functions
in a collection of annotated firmware binaries.

Currently, the following annotations are supported:

* A *WICED Studio* `patch.elf` file, which is a special ELF file containing only symbol definitions.
* A `.symdefs` file as it is produced by most ARM compilers.
* A `.csv` file with a format documented in the `firmware` folder.

These annotations contain the address, size, and name of known functions.
The more commonalities the input binaries in the history collection have, the better for *Polypyus* performance
and results. Given several slightly different functions, *Polypyus* creates very good matchers.


## How to install it

*Polypyus* requires Python 3 >= 3.6.
We advise the use of a virtualenv for the following installation.
Clone this repository and in this folder run:

```bash
pip install .
```

## How to run it

After the installation the following commands are available:

* `polypyus-gui`
* `polypyus-cli`

## Using Polypyus

*Polypyus* is available through a graphical and a command-line interface.
Both, the GUI `polypyus-gui` and the CLI `polypyus-cli`, take these arguments during invocation:

```bash
  --verbose is the verbosity level. By default, it shows warnings -v shows info -vv show debug information.
  --project sets the location of the project file. This is either a file path or ":memory:".
  --help    Show help message.
```

The project option facilitates you to store your work for different contexts in different files
and also reopen them again.

### Using the GUI

The general GUI workflow goes from the left-hand side of the window to the right.
First, binaries are added to the history. Then, symbol annotations to the entries
in the history follow.
Afterward, target binaries can be added.
For the matching, hit `Create matchers from history`. Once the matchers are created, single targets
can be selected, or all targets can be matched by selecting `batch match`.
Finally, the findings can be exported to a `.csv` file.

In the following you can see a demo video where *Polypyus* only takes a few seconds to learn from two input
binaries, annotate them, create matchers, and apply matches to a new binary.

[![GUI Video](doc/polypyus_video_preview.jpg)](doc/gui_demo.mp4)


### Using the CLI

The upside to using the CLI is its ability to be automated.
As of now, the output format of the CLI is subject to change.
However, here is an example of calling it:

```bash
polypyus-cli --history firmware/history/20819-A1.bin --annotation firmware/history/20819-A1_patch.elf --history firmware/history/20735B1.bin --annotation firmware/history/20735B1_patch.elf --project test.sqlite
polypyus-cli --target firmware/history/20739B1.bin --project test.sqlite
```

The first command creates `test.sqlite` as a new project file and imports `20819-A1.bin` and `20735B1.bin`
with their respective `patch.elf` files.
The second invocation reuses the same project file and matches against the binary `20739B1.bin`.
For each command, the number of `--history` and `--annotation` needs to match.
These two commands could also be combined into one by adding the `--target` argument to the first command.

### How does it work internally?

A paper that explains the internals was published at the *Workshop on Binary Analysis Research (BAR) 2021*
with the title *Polypyus - The Firmware Historian*.
Some more details are also contained in 
[Jan's Master thesis final presentation](doc/jan_msc-final-presentation.pdf), which covers the issues encountered
when working with conventional binary diffing approaches in ARM Thumb2 mode, and how the alternate binary-only
approach works.


## Additional PDOM type information export and import

The leaked symbols in the `patch.elf` or `.symdefs` format only contain function and
global variable names. However, there are also a couple `.pdom` Eclipse project files
in WICED Studio 6.2 and 6.4. These contain additional type information. Eclipse uses them
internally for auto completion, function search, etc., and we can utilize them in reverse
to add type information. Since `.pdom` files only contain partial, cached information, it
can be helpful to combine multiple of them.

In a first step, we export `.pdom` type information into an SQLite database. The export
takes a while, but it can even be aborted and continued later on. Export works as follows:

```
java -jar pdom/export/export.jar -P BCM20739-B0.1462220149391.pdom
```

The PDOM import searches for function names in an IDA database, looks them up in the PDOM to search
for type information, and then applies that type information into the IDA database. Thus, the IDA
database needs to contain correct function names in advance. In principle, these can be created with
the [import_export](import_export) scripts from Polypyus. However, the somewhat more advanced scripts
that support PDOM import can also handle `patch.elf` sections. Run the importer as follows:

* Open the firmware binary in IDA.
* Set Thumb mode to `T=0x1` (Alt-g).
* Set the compiler options (Options -> Compiler...) to GNU C++.
* Run the script file [pdom/import/main.py](pdom/import/main.py) (File -> Script file).
* Select an `patch.elf` file (Select file).
* Import it (Import ELF). After a few seconds you will have sections and function names.
* Select a reference database, which should be the PDOM that belongs to your firmware binary.
* Select multiple additional databases, and the importer will pick the best combined matches.
* Import it (Import PDOM). This will take a while.
* You can also import a hardware register file `20739mapb0.h` to name hardware registers (Import map.h).

This script was tested on IDA Pro 7.4 and 7.5.

## Recommended IDA Pro workflow

After some internal testing, we can recommend the following workflow when working with *IDA Pro* and *Polypyus*:

* Create a fresh database. ARM v7 little endian, ARM Cortex M for the Bluetooth firmware.
* Mark position 0x0 as Thumb (`Alt-g`, `T=0x1`).
* Create ROM and RAM segments. ROM at `0x0` with `rx`, RAM at `0x200000` with `rwx` (at least for the Bluetooth firmware).
* Create vector table offsets in ROM, at least for the reset vector, which is a 4-byte offset at `0x4` (`o`).
  On the *CYW20735* firmware it points to `0x3bc+1`. Go back one byte and create a function (`p`).
* Wait for auto analysis to finish.
* Import *Polypyus* results.
* Run the [Thumbs Up](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/Karta/blob/master/src/thumbs_up/thumbs_up_firmware.py) scripts.
* Run both [BinDiff](https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff.html) and [Diaphora](http://diaphora.re/).
  The latter ideally in an IDA version with decompiler. Use both, as they use different heuristics.

...now your IDA database might be somewhat useful :) Still a lot of things the disassembler
fails at within ARM Thumb2 but way better than anything IDA does on its own.


## Broadcom Bluetooth firmware history

The `firmware` folder contains various firmware with and without symbols.
Everything in the [history](firmware/history) contains symbols, everything in [targets](firmware/targets) is without symbols.

Dump quality might vary, some are with RAM and some are just the ROM.
We have access to most of the devices in this list. If you need a dump with
most recent patch levels and including RAM, feel free to ping us.

A few devices mentioned in the paper are not included here, since these might
not be research-only devices etc. A few iPhones and MacBooks are missing as well,
since we have them as research-only devices but the original dump wasn't. These
devices will be added soon :)

### How to install test and development dependencies

To install test dependencies execute

```bash
pip install '.[test]'
```

this will install packages that are only needed for executing test cases.


Developement dependencies, provide for example stubs for package types. To install them run

```bash
pip install '.[development]'
```

### Testing

`pytest` will run all tests.  

#### Locally testing against different versions of Python

The project uses tox to locally run the tests against different versions of python.
Tox is setup to test against versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9
To run tox install the test dependencies and install these 4 mentioned versions of python.
Our recommended way to install and manage several versions of python on is pyenv.

Steps:

1. Install [ Pyenv ]( https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv )
2. Install [ Pyenv virtualenv ]( https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv )
3. Run 
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.9.1
   pyenv install 3.8.6
   pyenv install 3.7.9
   pyenv install 3.6.12
   pyenv virtualenv 3.9.1 polypyus
   penv local polypyus 3.8.6 3.7.9 3.6.12
   pip install '.[test]'
   pip install '.[development]'
   ```
4. Run `tox`

### Local automation

Polypyus uses GitHub Actions for automated test runs and some linting. If you
want you can run the linting steps locally with on pre-commit git hooks.

Every time before a new commit is created this will trigger the linting and
show the issues that would prevent this code from succeed in the GitHub Actions
linting step. It will also format changed files with [ black ](https://github.com/psf/black).

```bash
pip install '.[development]'
pre-commit install
```
